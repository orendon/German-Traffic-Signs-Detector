# model3
LeNet-5 using Tensorflow.

Implementation on [kiwi/lenet5.py](/kiwi/lenet5.py) file.

## CLI usage

The main features of the app are `train`, `test` and `infer`.

**Here is a [SHORT VIDEO](https://cl.ly/0d232o450U1t) explaining the CLI usage for `model1` (the same commands apply for `model2` and `model3`)**

Also, you can use `python app.py --help` to know more about the commands

## Inference
Here is an example of the `infer` command output using LeNet-5 (model3)
